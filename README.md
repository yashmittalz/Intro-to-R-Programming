# Introduction to R Programming and Data Structures

## Overview
This project explores the foundations of data science using R and RStudio. It focuses on understanding R's atomic objects, manipulating vectors and matrices, and working with data frames for data analysis. The work demonstrates core programming concepts essential for statistical computing and data wrangling.

## Key Concepts and Features

### 1. Atomic Objects & Basic Types
- **Character/Strings**: Handling text data.
- **Integers & Doubles**: Working with numerical data and understanding the difference between store types.
- **Logicals**: Boolean logic (TRUE/FALSE) for control flow and filtering.
- **Factors**: Representing categorical data.

### 2. Vectors & Matrices
- **Creation & Manipulation**: Creating sequences, repeating patterns, and combining vectors.
- **Indexing**: Accessing elements using positive/negative integers and logical masking.
- **Operations**: Element-wise arithmetic, vector recycling rules, and matrix multiplication.
- **Coercion**: Implicit and explicit type conversion (e.g., numeric to character).

### 3. Data Structures
- **Lists**: Handling heterogeneous collections of objects.
- **Data Frames**: Storing and manipulating tabular data (rows as cases, columns as variables).
- **Special Values**: Handling `NA` (missing), `NaN` (not a number), and `Inf` (infinity).

### 4. Data Frames Exploration with `iris`
- **Subsetting**: extracting rows and columns using `[ ]`, `$`, and `subset()`.
- **Filtering**: Using logical operators (`&`, `|`) to query data (e.g., visualizing specific species).
- **Visualization**: Basic plotting with `plot()` to explore relationships between variables (e.g., Petal Length vs. Sepal Length).

## Technologies
- **Language**: R
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / RStudio

## Files
